Be here to fuck.\", '', '', \"Fellow Apes, I have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the RH shutdown. I have done some analysis and would like to shares my results. This is not investment advice and should not be construed as such.\\n\\nI know you guys can't read, but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this.🚀🚀🚀\\n\\n**Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?**\\n\\nAs we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.\\n\\n[Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/XyG9sfV)\\n\\n[Here is a tweet from Ihor (S3) stating the short interest data as of the 28th](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)\\n\\nPer S3, Short Interest was 62.9M as of the 27th and 57.8M as of the 28th. The net SI is (57.8M)-(62.9M)= -5.08M. This means the net short position reduced by 5.08M shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.\\n\\nWell lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum, i.e. retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.\\n\\nTo establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482.85. If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened 15.8M more short positions. ~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining 5.8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480.\\n\\nThis means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add ~15.8M short positions at an average ~$300. This is assuming **no covering** was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price **went up.**\\n\\nNow, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only 10.4M in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover 10.4M positions, and 5.7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only 4.7M could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that **covering would drive the price up, not down.**\\n\\nLastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of ~9.2M in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add 9.2M at an average of ~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.\\n\\nSo even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of ~$280, while covering only 10.4M at exorbitant costs.\\n\\nThis likely didn't happen, for several reasons. \\n\\nFirst, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.\\n\\nSecond, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase. \\n\\nThird, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time. \\n\\nFourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was **hard to borrow.** \\n\\nWhat is more likely is the **inverse** of the above, which would mean shorts covered 15.8M shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold 10.4M shares at an average of $250, before further covering 9.2M at an average of $250. **Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.**\\n\\nThat means hedge funds **are not** kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.\\n\\n**Part 2: What About Last Friday?**\\n\\nNow this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.\\n\\n[Here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/nU0JOXs)\\n\\n[Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356018482471718916?s=20)\\n\\nNow I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is **how could it be remotely possible?**\\n\\nS3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.\\n\\n[Also note that Short Volume was 17.6M on Friday](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)\\n\\nSo on Friday there was 50M in volume. 17.6M of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (57.8 SI as of the 28th)+(17.6M shares sold short) = 75.4M. In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as [S3 said](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752?s=20), it would have required the covering of (75.4M)-(27M) = 48.4M shares. **How do you cover 48.4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17.6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?**\\n\\n**There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most, 32.4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (75.4M)-(32.4M) = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.**\\n\\nFurthermore I want to draw attention to **other times shares were covered** and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.\\n\\n[S3 claims](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from ~69M to ~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an >100% increase.\\n\\nThey then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally **exponential growth** in the share price **despite no change in SI**. But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?\\n\\nThere was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of >31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price? \\n\\n**Part 3: How Could They Do It?**\\n\\n[Read this post, and the sources within it, in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/?ref=share&ref_source=link)\\n\\nShorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered **when they have not**\\n\\nThere were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.\\n\\nWhy was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also **did not** shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position. \\n\\nThey want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.\\n\\nTLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts. They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday, it would have been impossible based on volume alone. They want you to think they did, they need you to, but they did not.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, nor am I licensed or in any way qualified to dictate or advise your trading decisions.

Right now it's a fight between puts and calls at strike 60 to stay in the money. [Max Pain Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp) says the longs and shorts will fight over their strikes with the highest volume as expiration approaches, ultimately making the the maximum number of calls expire OTM.\\n\\nBut there are 89,000 call options expiring friday from $60-$120 that MMs will have to hedge as the price increase. Shorts are going to do anything they can to keep it down below that to save themselves.\\n\\nThere are another 60,000 puts that are expiring today that market makers will have to unhedge as the price rises, also contributing to a gamma squeeze.\\n\\nThere are another 90k calls from $120 to $800 that are almost completely unhedged, but I'm also not expecting us to pump all the way up to the 800s to squeeze those so i've excluded them from the main numbers.\\n\\nThese are personal opinions/my guesses and not investment advice. I've also got so much GME that I can't do anything but stare at this stupid chart all day.\\n\\n\\n**TL;DR:** In total that's 15,000,000 million shares they'd have to buy today of which they've only hedged about 3 million so far (rough estimate based on eyeballing the delta). That's a whole lot of squeeze if we can find the juice. \\n*Edit for the requested rocket ships 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\", '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Long post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing.

I spoke to mod on the team after and he kindly agreed to approve it.)\\n\\nTLDR: Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven\\'t truly covered. Full version below.\\n\\nThere’s an insightful piece on [https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies there are two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.\\n\\nFirst way is retail investors not holding the line and panic selling thereby driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nQuoting from Tradesmithdaily:\\n\\nPlummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nHowever the other scenario where this can occur is the hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nTo now quote verbatim from Tradesmithdaily:\\n\\nThe way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.\\n\\nThe tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.\\n\\nThe SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can\\xa0[read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).\\n\\nThe memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:\\n\\n* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.\\n* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.\\n* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.\\n* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.\\n* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.\\n* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.\\n\\nIt gets very complicated, very fast.\\n\\nBut the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.\\n\\nBelow is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:\\n\\n*“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*”\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nIn short (no pun intended) these tricks\\xa0“help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”, which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry’s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.\\n\\nThese factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions that they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located.\\n\\nSeparately but potentially related, S3 released updated short numbers last Sunday reducing from their projection of short interest from 122% to 113% (a day later on Friday) to 55% on Sunday (while markets were closed therefore in my estimation using the same data set that calculated 113%), which many found to be suspicious. Later it was found that this new number was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of adding synthetic long shares into the short float equation which is against standard practice.\\n\\nFor a more detailed breakdown a user here pasted a good analysis of how those numbers were reached [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\\\\_this\\\\_they\\\\_are\\\\_screwed\\\\_numbers\\\\_dont\\\\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nExcerpt:\\n\\nThe real short % according to S3\\'s data is 122%. However, their 55% figure is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading. I will explain everything.\\n\\nHere is what they did:Sources (S3 head):[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650)\\n\\nS3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don\\'t exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.\\n\\nit reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)\\n\\nSo, by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100, short % is calculated like this:400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs whose shares are borrowed) = 0.8That is, the normal way we define short % would say it\\'s 400% shorted. S3\\'s way says 80%.\\n\\nKnowing this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short % of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:55% short of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side of the trade \"longs whose shares were borrowed away to short\") is 55/45 as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 = 1.22\\n\\nThat is, S3\\'s data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nMany have pointed out this could be manipulation on S3’s part. It’s interesting to note that as late as the Jan 29th, Ihor from S3 stated most GME shorts have not covered and net shares shorted hadn\\'t moved much at all ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)). Initially on the 28th he claimed short interest float to be 122% ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322)). The next day he claimed short interest to be 113% ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755)) of float. 2 days later on Sunday, S3 released a report on the calculated short interest to be 55% (oddly their original announcement tweet appears deleted, but found this [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897)), which was confusing to many as this was a big discrepancy in short percentage in a short time. It turned out this percentage was calculated by including synthetic longs into the equation which is a practice that is not standard, thereby yielding a lower short interest percentage of 55% which the media then bandied around before and during market open on Monday. Whether this involved collusion to harm the retail investor I cannot conclusively say as I don’t have the evidence to conclusively make that claim, but definitely something to consider along with all other data points.\\n\\nWith the possibility of Synthetic Long Shares being used in a fraudulent way, if you care about how this could play out if we force the issue, I would recommend you to follow instructions from this comment [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how\\\\_gme\\\\_can\\\\_still\\\\_be\\\\_a\\\\_great\\\\_play/gm2tsnw/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and call or email Gamestop Investor Relations and ask them to call an emergency share holder meeting to save the company from bankruptcy, as calling this vote means calling shares back to owners eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from short selling funds participating in fraudulent activity\\n\\nEdit: Something I want to note, if you think about GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there could be other players involved but for the purpose of this thought experiment we\\'ll focus on these two), you have to consider that funds have an information advantage (they know the positions they\\'re truly in and can share data with each other) whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important information/data points. Large groups are also susceptible to being manipulated and this is why it\\'s important to try to find as much information and facts as we possibly can as a community and vet it as best we can to make sure there is no misinformation. My opinion: Always do your own research and employ critical thinking. For the diamond hands out there, it can be tough to hold in lieu of good information to make informed decisions, so I really hope people that are smarter than me and with more information will step up and share their insights on the ongoing situation.\\n\\nThere\\'s an adage I\\'ve seen on here which is that we/retail investors can be irrational funds longer than funds can stay solvent. I disagree, I think the short side funds are taking a long play and so far it\\'s working well for them because funds can stay solvent longer than \"we\"/paper hands can stay patient, but if we know their game we can counter it. From the Art of War, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” The more we understand how hedge funds think and operate, the more it will benefit us in navigating the situation intelligently.\\n\\nThis part to follow is purely my opinion and speculation so take it as nothing more then such: the HF side employed the Art of War well. They knew the weakness of the retail side was lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature this is an issue as any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if price drops low many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposable whether thats misinformation or Short Ladder Attacks which are frequently mentioned as an example and there could be others (there\\'s arguments on both sides of whether Short Ladder Attacks really exist and I won\\'t get into it here, I encourage you to do your own research and draw your own opinion from it), therefore dividing the community - divide and conquer.\\n\\nObligatory \"Not Financial Advice\" for all of the above.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to read more into the subject of synthetic long shares and how it could be currently misused in the context of GME. here are more solid posts that are related to this subject that I recommend you check out:\\n\\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lalucf/i\\\\_suspect\\\\_the\\\\_hedgies\\\\_are\\\\_illegally\\\\_covering/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lalucf/i_suspect_the_hedgies_are_illegally_covering/)\\n\\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\\\\_real\\\\_reason\\\\_wall\\\\_street\\\\_is\\\\_terrified\\\\_of\\\\_the/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lanf94/gme\\\\_is\\\\_a\\\\_time\\\\_bomb\\\\_and\\\\_its\\\\_highlighting\\\\_a\\\\_severe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lanf94/gme_is_a_time_bomb_and_its_highlighting_a_severe/)\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why\\\\_gme\\\\_short\\\\_interest\\\\_appears\\\\_to\\\\_have\\\\_fallen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/)\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec\\\\_doj\\\\_60\\\\_minutes\\\\_public\\\\_data\\\\_suggests\\\\_massive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/)\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9z88h/evidence\\\\_of\\\\_massive\\\\_naked\\\\_short\\\\_selling\\\\_fraud\\\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9z88h/evidence_of_massive_naked_short_selling_fraud_in/)\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbydkz/s3\\\\_partners\\\\_s3\\\\_si\\\\_of\\\\_float\\\\_metric\\\\_is\\\\_total/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbydkz/s3_partners_s3_si_of_float_metric_is_total/)', \"Special shoutout to /u/UnempRetardaddy, who inspired me to write up this explanation. Unfortunately, WSB investors have picked up some half-truths with limited information, and are reaching a whole bunch of incorrect conclusions which they're using to justify advice to other traders. BAD MONKEYS.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\n* Short attacks are real\\n* Short ladder attacks are not\\n* Any stock that falls 10% in one day is placed on a short-sale restriction for the next day\\n* Short-sale restriction *doesn't* prevent short selling\\n* It *does* effectively prevent short attacks\\n* GME was short-sale restricted today, which is why no short attacks could take place to drive the price down. All downward price movement was caused by shareholders.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLet's go into detail:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Are Short Attacks real, and what are they?**\\n\\nYes. A short attack is simply selling so many shares short that you drive the market price down due to oversupply vs demand. *This works the exact same way as if a shareholder was selling their actual shares, and not borrowed ones.*\\n\\nLet's imagine that a bunch of shares are all sold at market price at once. What happens?\\n\\nSince they are sold at market price, they automatically meet the bid price offered by the highest bidder in the marketplace, then the next highest bidder, etc. As long as more shares are being sold than there are orders at the highest bid price, then the sale will continue to the next highest bid price, which drops the market price of the stock (market price simply being the last price the stock was sold at).\\n\\nIf the current highest bid is $100 a share for 100 shares,and the next highest bid on the books is for $99 a share at 1000 shares...Then to drop the market price down $99, I need to sell 100 shares at market price.And if I want to drop the market price down past $99 (to whatever the next highest bid is), I need to sell 1100 shares.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**What are the risks of launching a short attack?**\\n\\nWhen a hedge fund tries a short attack, they are taking a risk that there is more demand to buy shares at current market price than there is supply of shares they are willing to short sell.\\n\\nIf Melvin tries to short 1 million shares at $100 market price, but 10M shares worth of market price buy orders are immediately placed because people see the price dropping and want to buy the dip, then due to high demand vs supply the share price will go *above* $100, and now Melvin is in the red on their short position. For a real world example of this happening, see TSLA throughout 2020.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**What makes a short attack successful?**\\n\\n* Low trading volume - if there aren't a lot of buy orders on the books, there are fewer orders to meet at each price point, and fewer shares need to be sold to drive the price down.*For example: Thurs 1/28, when brokerages halted buying and artificially reduced demand*\\n* Large supply of shortable shares - there are only so many shares for a company, and only so many of those that shareholders are willing to lend out for short selling. A short seller needs a large enough supply to (temporarily)  overwhelm demand.*For example: Despite shorts available for GME being at or near 0, MMs were (legally) allowed to 'naked short', creating artificial supply which allowed hedge funds to short sell at the $500 peak on Thurs (and yes, its as unfair as it sounds)*\\n* Paper-handed bitches - This is the real key to success. If actual shareholders notice the price dropping and decide to sell as well, it creates a compounding effect, where supply increases even more, and price drops even more, and even more people decide to sell. This can also be caused by price drops triggering stop orders, as well as triggering margin calls by driving accounts below margin maintenance.\\n* Psychological manipulation - This is a corollary to the previous point. If every shareholder had a sense that the price drop was only due to a short attack, they'd probably hold. But if they see news stories saying shorters closed their positions, that everyone is switching to buying silver, that brokers are halting buying and no one can help drive the price up... well, it makes it a lot easier to justify selling.\\n\\nFor the greatest example of all four of these elements at work, see GME between last Thursday and this Monday, between the brokerage restrictions (and the Market Maker margin reqs behind them), the media misinformation campaigns, the incredible abuse of naked shorting in the name of 'market liquidity', and the reality of the bull side being a lot of retail investors without deep pockets who overextended at high prices and didn't have enough collective reserves to buy the dips, so they ended up selling.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Are Short** ***Ladder*** **Attacks real?**\\n\\nThe claim behind a short ladder attack is similar to the Short Attack described above, with the added flavoring that colluding hedge funds are just selling back and forth to each other. This is impossible.\\n\\nNote, per above, that *short attacks* are quite real. What makes a short ladder attack nonsense is the belief that hedge funds can direct who their sell orders go to, or that it's possible to constantly bid a price down in an open market place, where anyone can place a market 'buy' order and prevent the price from dropping till their order is met.\\n\\nThe closest we came to this notion was last Thursday, where the big players just straight up cheated and shut down much of the buy side of the market, so that, in effect, hedge funds may very well have just been short selling to each other. But that is more due to the environment created by those (hopefully unique) events.\\n\\nShoutout to /u/EmptySet2 for his further breakdown of why it's not a real thing, here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the\\\\_myth\\\\_of\\\\_the\\\\_short\\\\_ladder\\\\_attack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**What is the Short Sale Rule (aka 'Alternative Uptick Rule' aka 'Rule 201' aka 'Short-Sale Restriction')?**\\n\\nThere's a bit of history here, with some changes to the rules over time. I'll talk about most recent version of this restriction, which was implemented in 2010:\\n\\n1. If any security falls more than 10% within a single trading day, it triggers the 'Alternative Uptick Rule' for the remainder of that day, and for the duration of the next trading day.\\n2. While that rule is in place, short selling is only permitted if the price of the security is above the current national best bid (aka on the uptick).\\n\\nThis is required to be enforced by the system as a whole. For this rule to be broken, everyone would have to be in on it, from brokers to clearing entities to market makers. It would be a big fucking deal.\\n\\nSource: [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-26.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-26.htm)\\n\\nSource for monkeys: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**How does this stop a short attack?**\\n\\nRecall from earlier that a short attack is just selling a bunch of shares at market price, driving the price down as you meet each next highest bid.\\n\\nWell, quite simply, while GME is short-sale restricted, short sellers *cannot* sell their shorted shares to the current highest bidder. They have to set their own ask price above that highest bid price, and wait for a buyer to meet it.\\n\\nWhat does this mean? It means that on a day like today, a short attack by its very nature isn't permitted to happen. *All short selling can do on a day like today is suppress the price from going up*. If the current share price is $60, a hedgie could short sell 10 million shares at an ask of $60.01, and thus the price wouldn't go past that until all 10 mil are bought out.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**What does this mean about current stay of play of GME?**\\n\\nBroadly put, for the past week there have been alternating days of massive short attacks, followed by lulls or even upward price movement during the short-sale restricted days.\\n\\nYesterday there was a whole lot of shorting and/or shareholders exiting positions, driving the price down more than 10%. Today, we saw a relatively stable price as only shareholders could sell at market price.\\n\\nPut 2 and 2 together and take a wild guess what's coming Monday.\\n\\n(Edit: a short attack. That's what's coming. Or maybe it isn't, it's just going to be possible again. Just be aware of the possibility that wasnt there today. ) \\n\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nPosition: 1000 shares and 5 calls\", '', 'This isn’t some ideological battleground. This is the stock market.

Nobody will ever KNOW.  Taking advice from anyone on the internet or in real life, especially when finances are involved is idiotic.  Quickly think about every comment you’ve made pumping GME with rockets and Diamond emojis this month?  Ever wonder why you were doing that?  Because you had a particular interest and benefit of the stock price going up — that’s pumping so you can get the price high enough for you to make money and then leave the others in the dust.  This is the exact thing pumpers are doing to you.  It is VITAL that you stop relying on Reddit comments, start doing research, and put your time to good use since time is in fact, money.\\n\\n• *The market is so manipulated, it’s completely unfair and the hedge funds always get away with it!*\\n\\n- Yes.  You’re right & that is a healthy and intelligent observation.  The unfortunate truth is this will keep happening.  There are forces at work so much bigger than any of us and if any of you were a part of the top .01% you would also be clinging on to the power and greed of owning the world — or you at least wouldn’t relinquish that power to a bunch of college kids on an online forum.  I love the underdog, everybody wanted a David and Goliath ending to this but it’s just not feasible and it’s time you stop taking your decision to over-leverage and/or fail to take profit,  out on the market.   It is important you begin to study and understand the trends and statistics behind the actual market.  Please, the slightest bit of REAL research could lead to your next play — the one that could save you from this GME mess.  If you learned how to trade options you could’ve bought puts and at least balanced out your losses on your GME shares on the way down instead of just eating those bags.\\n\\n• *So what, I just sell my GME shares for a huge loss?*\\n\\n- No.  I would never instruct anybody to sell or buy anything.  That’s the entire point of this post.  To encourage others to learn how instruct themselves in the stock market (considering how many of you are completely new & your first trade may have possibly been one of the most volatile in recent history).  Keep your shares, that’s the beauty of shares is that you own them and over time that value may eventually come back, especially if you use other equity to generate enough money to average down your position over time & eventually come out on top.  The only way you will achieve this though is removing GME from your watchlist for a while, studying up & finding new tickers with real promise instead of “short squeeze” opportunities and quick spike situations where you will inevitably be fucked.\\n\\n• *I used all my money on this last play, I can’t do anything now*\\n\\n- Even if that is the case, I’d hope you still have an income or the ability to collect some money over the next few weeks and months WHILE YOU STUDY.  The perfect opportunity to learn is when you’re forced to watch market action without being able to participate.

Thank you.', '', 'Fellow retards,\\n\\nI have a couple points I\\'d like to discuss. I owned GME and sold it most of them when Robinhood screwed us for good. I made TENDIES which is what mattered and why I have been in the sub. I\\'m not a paid hedge fund bot or shill but I AGREE that hedge funds would love the current state of this sub in my smooth opinion.\\n\\nI\\'ve been following the sub around a year. I was a retard and brained washed by boomer financial advices which didn\\'t make me a lot of TENDIES. I got hooked in during March/April when the stock market crashed and autists made fortunes with puts on SPY and calls on Tesla. I was amazed by beautiful retardness.\\n\\nWSB did something truly amazing. GME was the trade of this quarter century. A dude in basement with DDs and bunch of retards did something crazy. Thousands of retards made thousands of dollars. It has changed lifes for good for many people.\\n\\nHowever, the sub has been fallen victim to its success. Let me be clear, the GME was to make Tendies. Taking out a hedge fund was a bonus not the purpose because we know the game is rigged. It\\'s what it is. Unless you have a trillion dollar, you are not likely to change wall street for retail traders and retards. When GME took off and went viral, truly mentally challenged people of reddit homepage jumped on it and it has been transformed into a \"movement\". TVs, newspapers show this as little guys take on wall street and Elon Musk and Mark Cuban supported this(positions or ban?talk is cheap) I read bunch of comments and got heartbroken that people got in to make money and destroy hedge funds. Now, GME is the only thing. We have lost Tesla gang,Palantir gang,Palenton gang,theta gang who had provided real DD and were the people who came up with GME along with many other trades. Those people made WSB a place where retards gamble but with some sort of fundamental that can increase you change from 0 to 4.2069% Now we cannot hear them due to noise.\\n\\nNow, the sub is filled with people who just yell \"HOLD!!!!!\" \"BUY MORE\" \"WHO HOLDS????\" \"GME WILL GO TO MOON\". I hope it does and people who got fucked recover. BUT THIS REDUCES THE SUB INTO A SINGLE TRADE where previously there were chances you can actually hear new retarded things that could make you money. Guess who benefits from this current state? GME Diamond Hands with $1000? or Wall St. who is playing carrot on a stick.\\n\\nA hedge fund made $700M on GME. Citadel who has shady relationships with Robinhood made tons of money as market maker because of insane increase of volume. A lot of hedge funds shorted at $300s and made millions. And we are bombarded with truly stupid posts of \"WHO HOLDS GME????$5000 IS NOT A MEME\" I\\'d love hearing DDs like DFVs and explain the game plan but these people are actually retards. They just yell some slogans and getting emotional. Sharing the old finra report won\\'t help US.\\n\\nI wholeheartedly hope that GME holders are right, it goes to $5000 and makes millions. I\\'d be happy for them but if we narrow to one trade (or BANG), we actually give up millions of TENDIES on other trades. We don\\'t get new info. We don\\'t get new DDs. Please stop spamming and provide actual DD so it can actually bring people back on GME if you are right. This would help you too.\\n\\nWe need to find our next GMEs. That\\'s how you make TENDIES. We need retards who got stuff right like messiah DFV so we can win. Everytime we make a good trade, you actually fight off the rigged system.\\n\\ntl;dr: GME narrows down us to a single trade. We need to restore our DNA and get DDs,reduce noise and hear new things that can make us TENDIES.

Meaning, anything from the Feb 1 til now is not included.\\n\\n\\nSo what happened leading up to the 29th? On the 28th, Robinhood and other brokers restricted purchasing of shares. Collusion or not, it sent the price plumetting to sub 200. Situation was great for the shorts to cover their positions a bit and make their report kosher. Price recovered a bit on Friday after some purchasing was allowed. However, by this time, the shorts already fixed their books to not get in trouble.\\n\\n\\n2: Now that the 29th has come and gone and the hedgies had something to hand over to the SEC, they started doubling down. Starting from Monday, EVERYONE noticed the aggressive short ladder attack and more shorts were being done.\\n\\n\\n3: Prices have plunged from $325 close on the 29th to $53.50 by close Thursday 2/4.
